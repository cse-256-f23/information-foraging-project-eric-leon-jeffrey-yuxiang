            <p>All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking lot entrance west of the school,
                driving east and stopping at the school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the
                children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning
                session and 12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session. At no time should your child be allowed to exit your
                car without a teacher present. If you arrive late, you must escort your child to the classroom. At
                dismissal (11:45 a.m. and 3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or, in
                inclement weather, inside the front door. The teachers bring children to their cars. No child can be
                dismissed to anyone other than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must hold
                hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in the drop-off/pick-up area.</p>
