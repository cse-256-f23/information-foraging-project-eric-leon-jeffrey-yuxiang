            <h1>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h1>

            <p>Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations
                and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child,
                writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes
                checklists, timelines and examples of the children's writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly
                to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.</p>

            <p>The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal,
                getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written
                assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by
                request of parents and/or teachers.</p>

            <p>The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to read and
                understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p>
